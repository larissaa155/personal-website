# My Personal Website With VUE 3
This is my website that I created using Vue 3 and Vite. I made this a single-page website with different sections you can scroll through - a home page about me, a projects section showing stuff I've worked on, and a contact form where people can reach me.

# Features
* ref(): Used for creating reactive state variables (visitor counter, form data)
* v-model: Two-way data binding for form inputs in the Contact section
* v-for: Rendering project lists dynamically
* v-if & v-show: Conditional rendering for welcome messages and project availability
* v-on: Event handling for button clicks and form submissions
* watch(): Monitoring changes in form inputs and reactive state
* computed(): Calculating derived values like project counts or filtered lists
